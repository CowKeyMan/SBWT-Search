      "found are represented by a -1 (which loops around to become the "

      "are separeted by a -3 (ULLONG_MAX-2). The binary version is much "
      "faster but requires decoding the file later when it needs to be "
      "viewed. 'boolean' is the fastest mode however it is also the least "
      "desriptive. In this mode, 2 files are output. The first file is named "
      "by the given output file name, and contains 1 bit for each result. "
      "The string sizes are given in another file, where every 64 bit "
      "integer here is a string size. This is the fastest and most condensed "
      "way of printing the results, but we lose some information because we "
      "cannot say wether the result is invalid or just not found. At the end "
      "of this data file, the final number is padded by 0s to the next "
      "64-bit integer. Here, every 64 bit binary integer "
      "represents the amount of results for each string in the original "
      "input file. In terms of file extensions, ASCII format will add .txt, boolean format will add .bool and binary format will add .bin and .seqsizes for the separate sequence sizes",
