Workflow Documentation
======================

This part of the documentation describes the workflow documentation, which is how to work with the repository in terms of writing code, building, running, testing, generating code coverage, building documenation and viewing the built code coverage and documentation. It is recommended to get started from these files:

* The :ref:`Getting Started` page shows a general overview of how to work with the project. This is useful if you want to browse through the project and maybe make some small changed.
* The :ref:`Tools` section will guide you towards downloading the necessary tools that are used for developing this project.
* The :ref:`File Documentation` page gives a description of each important file that exists in the repository.
