Tools
=====

The project was setup in a way to use good C++ practices. Here is discussed the tools which enforce those practices. Some of the tools use python, as such it is recommended to create a new python 3 environment for this workflow template.

Git Hooks
+++++++++

We make use of git hooks which are in the `hooks` directory. These will be executed if you set git hooks directory to this directory by issuing this command:

.. code-block:: bash

  git config core.hooksPath hooks

GCC
+++

Any C++20 compliant compiler will do, however the choice for this repository is C++20.


Installation
------------

Please note that you will need a modern Linux operating system to use the below command, as older versions might not have a modern enough (C++20 compliant) version of GCC. We will need at least GCC 11.

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo apt install build-essential

CMake
+++++

This is the tool used for compiling the project and documentation.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo apt install build-essential

We also use ccache as a (non essential) tool with cmake, to cache results of previous compilations and make future compilations run faster, so it is probably worth installing that as well.

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo apt install ccache

In case you cannot run apt, you can download cmake from the official website here: https://cmake.org/download/.

Doxygen
+++++++

This is the tool used to generate automated documentation from the C++ files, to allow navigation of the codebase by users without needing to go through the source files.

Installation
------------

Make sure that you install the correct version of Doxygen. At the time of writing, this repository is using Doxygen 1.9.2. The version can be found at the first line of docs/Doxyfile.in.

The easy way is to install using:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo apt install doxygen

However, to install the very latest doxygen, you may need to go through the (simple) installation steps here: https://www.doxygen.nl/download.html. Here are the installation commands:


.. code-block:: bash

  sudo apt install flex bison
  git clone https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen.git
  cd doxygen
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
  make
  sudo make install
  cd ../..
  rm -r build

You may encounter some missing dependencies when building doxygen (such as flex and bison above), in which case please install these in the same way we are installing flex and bison above.

Sphinx
++++++

Sphinx is a layer over Doxygen to generate more beautiful documentation. It reads the doxygen outputs and incorporates them into its own documentation. It also allows us to easily add more pages to the documentation, such as this page itself! We can use latex easily as well within our documentation with this tool. Traditionally it is used for Python documentation.

We use the extensions with Sphinx:
  * sphinx-rtd-theme: read the docs theme is used since it is great for documentation.
  * sphinx-rtd-dark-mode: dark mode for users which prefer this. It is easily togglable in the webpage
  * breathe: For reading doxygen output and parsing it
  * exhale: For outputting the doxygen content into Sphinx format

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install sphinx
  pip install breathe
  pip install exhale
  pip install sphinx-rtd-dark-mode
  pip install sphinx-rtd-theme

Mermaid
+++++++

For diagrams in the docentation we use Mermaid, which is a text based graph creator and needs to be installed separately.

Installation
------------

You may need an updated version of nodejs for this to work, as such, you can uninstall the current version you have using these commands

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo apt remove npm
  sudo apt remove nodejs
  sudo apt autoremove

Then install a newer version of nodejs (in this case version 18) using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  cd ~
  curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
  sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
  rm nodesource_setup.sh

Then you can install mermaid using the following:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install sphinxcontrib-mermaid
  npm install @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli


clang-format
++++++++++++

This tool is used for ensuring a consistent language format for c++ across developers. This includes using spaces vs tabs, how many tabs or spaces, if a line should be skipped after or before an opening curly brackets, etc.

**Official Documentation for Options**: https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html

At the time of writing, this repository is using version 16 of clang-format

Installation
------------

Go to https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases and download the latest version for your system. Note, the latest version might not have a build for your system, so go look for ones which do have a version for your system. Below you will find instructions for downloads for Ubuntu.

.. code-block:: bash

  cd /opt # This is the folder where we will put the executables
  sudo wget https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/download/llvmorg-16.0.0/clang+llvm-16.0.0-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-18.04.tar.xz -O clang+llvm.tar.xz # download your version (make sure to change the link!) and save it as a file named clang+llvm.tar.xz
  sudo tar xvf clang+llvm.tar.xz # extract it
  sudo rm clang+llvm.tar.xz
  sudo mv clang+llvm* clang+llvm
  sudo printf "\n#add clang to path\nexport PATH=\"/opt/clang+llvm/bin:\${PATH}\"" >> ~/.bashrc # Add to PATH (make sure to change the folder name version!)

googletest
++++++++++

The testing framework used is the popular googletest which can test both C and C++ code.

Installation
------------

Installation will be automatic when you run cmake as it will be done using FetchContect.

lcov
++++

This is the tool to display code coverage after running googletest. This tool was very difficult to set up on native Windows, hence for any Windows users, it is recommended to use WSL for code coverage, or else remove the parts of the scripts which use it (found in `scripts/test/test.sh`)

Unfortunately lcov does not capture CUDA `__device__` functions, hence we put these functions in separate *.cuh* files.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo apt install lcov

Github pages
++++++++++++

We use github pages to publish the documentation and code coverage. To set this up, we must have a separate branch called *gh-pages*. Then go to github, and in your repository's settings you can find the settings for the pages. Set this up so that it uses the root folder of your gh-pages branch.

HIP
+++

The kernels and kernel calls are HIP-ified so that we call CUDA (NVIDIA gpus) or ROCm (AMD gpus) (or CPU as well!) from a single codebase. This however instead requires multiple compilations if we want to compile for different target devices. This switch is a simple cmake option switch, which can be seen in `cmake/SetHipTargetDevice.cmake`. The target platform is chosen when we run `./scripts/build/release.sh` or any other build script.

CUDA
----

For CUDA installation, check the official installation guides, which can be found here: https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html. Note: WSL and Windows have their own guides. If you do not wish to use CUDA, you can switch the cmake option to CPU. For more information look at the **build** folder section in :ref:`File Documentation`.

ROCm
--------

To install ROCm, follow the instructions at: https://docs.amd.com/bundle/ROCm-Installation-Guide-v5.1/page/How_to_Install_ROCm.html.

The instructions on the site may be slightly complicated to follow, but TLDR, first navigate to 'Download and install the installer', where you will find commands to download a file wget and install it with apt. This will install a new command in your system called 'amdgpu-install'. If you then run `amdgpu-install --usecase=hiplibsdk`, you *SHOULD* have hip installed.

Unfortunately I do not have much experience with this as I was using a pre-configured system to test AMD products and do not have access to a fresh AMD machine to test this out with, so you will have to figure out the rest yourself if the above fails. I could not get HIP to compile locally. If you, the reader, have any insight on how one can install a ROCm installer on an AMD (or non-amd) platform, then please submit a pull request to this section of the documentation. Thank you ^-^.

CPU
---

On AMD platforms, we can use the HIP compiler to compile for this platform. By switching the platform to CPU, this will automatically download the necessary headers to run the kernels on the CPU using the repository https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP-CPU.

kseqpp_REad
+++++++++++

kseq++ is a program to read FASTA/Q files. Its repository is at https://github.com/cartoonist/kseqpp. We use another version of it which is kseqpp_Read whose repository is at: https://github.com/CowKeyMan/kseqpp_REad. However, it may neeed a dependency which is zlib.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo apt install zlib1g-dev # a dependency

spdlog
++++++

This is our logging tool. It is installed automatically by CMake. To see the logs when running the main program, simply run the below code and you will see a lot of logs. This is used for timing our code as well.

.. code-block:: bash

  export SPDLOG_LEVEL=TRACE

OpenMP
++++++

OpenMP allows us to use threading in C++ more easily.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo apt-get install libomp-de
